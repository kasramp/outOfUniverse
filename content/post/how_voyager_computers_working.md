I have always been passionate about Yoyager 1, 2 missions. One thing that I have never paid attention was how their computers
are working and still sending data to Earth since over 40 years ago. That means Voyager computers 
have the highest uptime of all the time, over 15K days.

So to learn more about the Yoyager computers, I did a quick search on the internet and came across this awesome video
explaining how Voyager computers are designed by Aaron Cummings.
