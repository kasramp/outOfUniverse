## A place on Earth, water but no life

Scientists found a place in Ethiopia where there's water but it has no living life, [link](https://www.universetoday.com/144161/finally-scientists-find-a-place-on-earth-with-liquid-water-but-no-life/).

What does it mean to us?

Well not very good news, I am afraid. That could indicate that even if there are places in and out of our solar system that have water, there might not be life there.
In all of the previous articles, I have stated clearly that in my opinion where ever there's water, there's some sort of life. But this is not the case anymore. So I have to take back my words :-)

But that's not all of it. Statistically speaking, still, there's a higher chance of finding life, where the water exists.
