## Possibilities of life in the solar system, Saturn's moon Titan

Well, I have some exciting news about the possibilities of life in the solar system. But this time is not Mars or Europa, it's about Titan, a Saturn's moon.
According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-titan/possibility-of-life-scientists-map-saturns-exotic-moon-titan-idUSKBN1XS2H2?feedType=RSS&feedName=scienceNews), data from NASAâ€™s Cassini spacecraft reveals the existence of carbon in Titan. This speculates scientists about the possibilities of life under the icy ocean in Titan.
My analysis, if the liquid water runs under the Titan icy ocean, the chance of microbiological life is higher than Mars.
