## Potential planets supporting life in the solar system


After a very long time, finally, I stopped procrastinating and start to write about astronomy again.

In this blog post, I go through the planets that potentially support life in our solar system. I'm doing it because scientists found new stuff recently and so many new news floating around.

## Mars

We are familiar with Mars, especially after successful [Curiosity Rover](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/index.html) landing. And it is getting more and more attractive as scientists make discoveries. Recently, they found that water may still exist on Mars in the northern hemisphere in some seasons, [source](https://www.universetoday.com/145034/salt-water-might-still-be-able-to-collect-on-the-surface-of-mars-a-few-days-a-year/).

Besides that two rovers scheduled to launch toward Mars in 2020. [Mars 2020](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/) and [Rosalind Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin_(rover). Hope they bring some positive news. More [here](https://www.space.com/nasa-insight-lander-mars-seismically-active.html).

## Europa

Europa is the smallest of the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter. It attracts many research and scientist speculating liquid water may run below the thick Europa surface. Besides that, [Clipper probe](https://www.space.com/37282-europa-clipper.html) will be launched in mid of this year to study the icy surface of the Europa.

## Enceladus

Enceladus is one of the smallest Saturn's moon with 505 km diameter. By contrast with Europa, not much attention is given to it. That could be because of its size but anyhow, it's one of the candidates. Enceladus like Europa has an icy surface. More about Enceladus [here](https://www.space.com/20543-enceladus-saturn-s-tiny-shiny-moon.html).

## Titan (less likely)

Before [this news](https://www.livescience.com/titan-is-lifeless-due-to-quantum-mechanics.html) Titan, the biggest Saturn's moon was on the top list along with Mars and Europa. But the recent study shows otherwise or at least it reduces the chances of Titan hosting life significantly.
