## More possibilities of life on Mars, Oxygen discovery

I read a great news today. Mars Curiosity has found Oxygen on Mars. This means higher chances of microorganism life on Mars. 
As we already knew Methane exists on Mars that raises during summer for unknown reasons. And now Oxygen discovery hypothetically speaking means the existence of some sort of life. Or the ability to supporting life on Mars.
I am very excited about it and can't wait for more detailed findings.
