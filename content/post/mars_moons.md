## Introduction
Recently, I have stumbled upon [an article](https://www.universetoday.com/144372/mars-express-takes-photos-of-phobos-as-it-flies-past/) about Mars moons. To be honest, I didn't know that Mars has any moons at all until I read the article. Anyhow, after reading the article, I decided to write a short blog post to introduce Mars moons for those, like me, who don't know about them.

## Mars moons
Mars has two moons named **Phobos** and **Deimos**. Phobos is the bigger one and Deimos is the smaller. Both have irregular shapes and compare with the earth-moon are too small.
The Phobos radius is **11.267 km**, and Deimos one is **6.2 km**. Whereas, the earth-moon has the radius of **1,737.1 km**.

Phobos rises from the west and sets in the east. This takes only **eleven hours**. Phobos has the average orbital period of **7 hours**, moon is **27 days** with the average orbital speed of **2.138 km/s**, moon is **1.022 km/s**.

## Deimos

On the other hand, Deimos rises from the east and sets in the west. This takes **131 hours** with the average orbital period of **1.263 days** and the average orbital speed of **1.3513 km/s**.
