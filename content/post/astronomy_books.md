## Some astronomy books for beginners

I have been following astronomy news for quite sometimes but never read a single book about astronomy. Most of knoweldge came from news and Wikipedia. Two days ago I [Space.com](https://space.com) tweeted a list of Astronomy and Sci-Fi books of 2019 which I believe worth sharing,

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Best Space Books and Sci-Fi for 2019 <a href="https://t.co/U4Nf3UGiZR">https://t.co/U4Nf3UGiZR</a> <a href="https://t.co/O4FVuIFryy">pic.twitter.com/O4FVuIFryy</a></p>&mdash; SPACE.com (@SPACEdotcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/SPACEdotcom/status/1189585791002955782?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Actual link, [here](https://www.space.com/28973-best-space-books.html). I think it is worth a shot. I'm gonna do some research and pick up one for my next reading.
