## Evidence of vapor water on Europa

This is the second good news from our solar system this week. Two days ago, Titan, and today Europa, the Jupiter moon.
As mentioned before scientists speculate the existence of a liquid ocean underneath the Europa icy surface. And today, [source](https://www.universetoday.com/144061/water-vapor-was-just-found-on-europa-more-evidence-theres-liquid-water-neneath-all-that-ice/), they have announced that they found evidence of vapor water.

What does it mean to us? It means more possibilities of supporting life on Europa. Who knows maybe some sort of life already exists in that liquid ocean. 

So far there are three places in the solar system that have the potential of supporting life: Mars, Titan (Saturn moon), and Europa (Jupiter moon).
