## Amazing alient worlds miniatures 

I know I have not posted for sometimes. But believe me, I was keeping eyes on the astronomy news but nothing interesting (at least me), came up. Until now of course! I guess that's why I am writing this post.

Well, this is mainly about art but since it is about alien worlds, my main interest, then I share it here. I have stumbled upon a post from [Universetoday.com](https://www.universetoday.com/) which was quite interesting to me. They have shared a number of miniatures pictures of alien worlds and they are eye catching. I highly recommend you to have a look at that post, [here](https://www.universetoday.com/144308/these-incredible-images-of-alien-worlds-are-actually-miniatures/). 

I share some of them here too.
