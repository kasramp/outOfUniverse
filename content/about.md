Out of Universe is an astronomy blog created by a computer geek, [Kasra Madadipouya](https://madadipouya.com).
Here, mainly the interesting astronomy news is shared with short analysis, especially on topics related to exoplanets (extra-solar planets), earth-like planets, Mars Curiosity rover, and Kepler, Voyager 1, 2 missions.
By no means what I write here is scientific. It is mainly driven based on my understanding of matters with some speculations and guesses.
