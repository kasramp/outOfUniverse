      <description>Where Earth life originated? First of all happy new year and wish all have a good year ahead.
It was during my holiday that I started to think where possibly Earth life originated. Was it there since the beginning of time? Or aliens introduced it? Or a meteorite hit the Earth at some point and brought some microbes survived all the way?
For that, I did some search on the net, as usual, and found an interesting article from Space.</description>

   What does it mean to us?
Well not very good news, I am afraid. That could indicate that even if there are places in and out of our solar system that have water, there might not be life there.</description>
