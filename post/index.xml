      <description>Some astronomy books I have been following astronomy news for quite sometimes but never read a single book about it. All my knoweldge comes from news and Wikipedia. Two days ago I saw Space.com tweeted a list of Astronomy and Sci-Fi books of 2019 which I believe worth sharing,

      <description>How Voyagers computers are running since 1977 I have always been passionate about Voyager 1, 2 missions. One thing that I have never paid attention to how their computers are working and still sending data to Earth for over 40 years ago. That means Voyager computers have the highest uptime of all the time, over 15K days.
So to learn more about the Voyager computers, I did a quick search on the internet and came across this awesome video explaining how Voyager computers are designed by Aaron Cummings.</description>
